        All you have to do is read the rules, and fill out a quick, little application to join the Server so we know you read them. We do this to keep the griefers/newbs out, it only takes three minutes, it's not that big of a deal.

        Jesse's Minecraft Server is a City Roleplay/Survival Server, there is a currency, public transportation, strict rules for immersive gameplay, and has a decent size population. Over 750 people have logged onto the server. It is very important you read the rules, we don't tolerate idiots.

        There are over 200 empty properties that are ready for anyone to own! Join now!

        This is the server state as of Feb. 27, 2011.
