# Place your ytdl-sub command(s) here.
#
# This script is executed in the same directory as this file which also contains the
# default `./config.yaml` and `./subscriptions.yaml`, so you don't need to use the
# `--config` CLI option or pass a `SUBPATH` to the `$ ytdl-sub sub` sub-command.
#
# To prevent users accidentally triggering throttles or bans or downloading before
# testing their configuration, these default options only simulate a few
# downloads. Remove the `--dry-run` and `-o ...` CLI options when you've tested your
# configuration and you're ready to download entries unattended:

ytdl-sub --dry-run sub -o '--ytdl_options.max_downloads 3'
