# This script is executed in the same directory as this file which also contains the
# default `./config.yaml` and `./subscriptions.yaml`, so you don't need to use the
# `--config` CLI option or pass a `SUBPATH` to the `$ ytdl-sub sub` sub-command.
#
# Test your configuration and subscriptions carefully before automating downloads to
# prevent triggering throttles or bans:

# Once you've tested your configuration and you're ready to download entries unattended,
# remove the next line and un-comment the following line:
echo "WARNING: Read /config/ytdl-sub-configs/cron and modify to automate downloads."
# ytdl-sub sub
