# The subscriptions in `subscriptions.yaml` uses prebuilt presets which do not require
# any additions to this config. They can be downloaded using the command:
#
#   ytdl-sub --config config.yaml sub subscriptions.yaml
#
# Or dry-ran with:
#
#   ytdl-sub --dry-run --config config.yaml sub subscriptions.yaml
#
# See the documentation above on how to build your own custom presets.
