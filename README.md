This package downloads media via 
[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
and prepares it for your favorite media player
([Kodi](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc), 
[Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin), 
[Plex](https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker),
[Emby](https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker),
modern music players).

We recognize that everyone stores their 
media differently. Our approach for file and metadata formatting is to provide
maximum flexibility while maintaining simplicity.

## How it Works
`ytdl-sub` uses YAML configs to define a layout for how you want media to look
after it is downloaded. See our
[example configurations](https://github.com/jmbannon/ytdl-sub/tree/master/examples)
that we personally use and
[readthedocs](https://ytdl-sub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#)
for detailed information on specific sections or fields. Downloading looks like this.

### Config
The `config.yaml` defines how our downloads will look. For this example, let's
download YouTube channels to look like TV shows, and generate `.nfo` files
so they appear in Kodi/Jellyfin/Emby.

```yaml
presets:
  # Each 'preset' defines a source, download strategy, and options for
  # configuring the download. We will name this preset 'yt_channel_as_tv'
  yt_channel_as_tv:
    
    # Use YouTube as our source. Our strategy is download the entire channel.
    # Configure channel-specific parameters to make images appear as artwork
    youtube:
      download_strategy: "channel"
      channel_avatar_path: "poster.jpg"
      channel_banner_path: "fanart.jpg"
    
    # Define media file output options using variables
    output_options:
      output_directory: "{youtube_tv_shows_directory}/{tv_show_name_sanitized}"
      file_name: "{episode_name}.{ext}"
      thumbnail_name: "{episode_name}-thumb.jpg"
    
    # Define 'override' variables, which can contain a mix of hardcoded strings
    # and 'source' variables that are derived from the video itself.
    overrides:
      youtube_tv_shows_directory: "/path/to/youtube_tv_shows"
      episode_name: "Season {upload_year}/s{upload_year}.e{upload_month_padded}{upload_day_padded} - {title_sanitized}"
     
    # Use the 'nfo_tags' plugin to generate an NFO file for each video.
    # See the config in the `examples/` directory for a full example
    nfo_tags:
      ...
```

### Subscriptions
The `subscriptions.yaml` file is where we define content to download using
presets in the `config.yaml`.
```yaml
# The name of our subscription
john_smith_channel:
  # Inherit all fields in the 'yt_channel_as_tv' preset
  preset: "yt_channel_as_tv"
  
  # Add the `channel_url` parameter here since it's unique for each subscription
  youtube:
    channel_url: "https://youtube.com/channe/UCsvn_Po0SmunchJYtttWpOxMg"
    
  # Similarly, define the {tv_show_name} variable since it's also unique to each
  # subscription.
  overrides:
    tv_show_name: "John Smith Vlogs"
```
The download can now be performed using:
```shell
ytdl-sub sub subscriptions.yaml
```
This method makes it easy to pull new videos from channels or playlists, or
experiment with new configurations.

### One-time Download
There are things we will only want to download once and never again. Anything
you can define in a subscription can be defined using CLI arguments. This
example is equivalent to the subscription example above:
```shell
ytdl-sub dl \
    --preset "yt_channel_as_tv" \
    --youtube.channel_url "https://youtube.com/channel/UCsvn_Po0SmunchJYtttWpOxMg" \
    --overrides.tv_show_name "John Smith Vlogs"
```

#### Download Aliases
In the `config.yaml`, we can define alias to make `dl` commands shorter.
```yaml
configuration:
  dl_aliases:
    tv: "--preset yt_channel_as_tv"
    channel: "--youtube.channel_url"
    name: "--overrides.tv_show_name"
```
The above command can now be shortened to
```shell
ytdl-sub dl \
    --tv \
    --channel "https://youtube.com/channel/UCsvn_Po0SmunchJYtttWpOxMg" \
    --name "John Smith Vlogs"
```

### Output
After `ytdl-sub` runs, the end result will download and format the channel
files into something ready to be consumed by your favorite media player or
server. The `--dry-run` flag can be used to view file output before any downloading occurs.
```

## Installation

The ytdl-sub docker image uses
[LinuxServer's](https://www.linuxserver.io/)
[base alpine image](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-baseimage-alpine).
It looks, feels, and operates like other LinuxServer images. This is the 
recommended way to use ytdl-sub.

ytdl-sub is a command-line tool. The docker image is intended to be used
as a console. For automating `subscriptions.yaml` downloads to pull new media, see
[this guide](https://ytdl-sub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#setting-up-automated-downloads)
on how set up a cron job in the docker container.

### Docker Compose
```yaml
services:
  ytdl-sub:
    image: ghcr.io/jmbannon/ytdl-sub:latest
    container_name: ytdl-sub
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/Los_Angeles
    volumes:
      - <path/to/ytdl-sub/config>:/config
      - <path/to/tv_shows>:/tv_shows # optional
      - <path/to/movies>:/movies # optional
      - <path/to/music_videos>:/music_videos # optional
      - <path/to/music>:/music # optional
    restart: unless-stopped
```
### Docker CLI
```commandline
docker run -d \
    --name=ytdl-sub \
    -e PUID=1000 \
    -e PGID=1000 \
    -e TZ=America/Los_Angeles \
    -v <path/to/ytdl-sub/config>:/config \
    -v <OPTIONAL/path/to/tv_shows>:/tv_shows \
    -v <OPTIONAL/path/to/movies>:/movies \
    -v <OPTIONAL/path/to/music_videos>:/music_videos \
    -v <OPTIONAL/path/to/music>:/music \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    ghcr.io/jmbannon/ytdl-sub:latest
```

### Building Docker Image Locally
Run `make docker` in the root directory of this repo to build the image. This
will build the python wheel and install it in the Dockerfile.

### Virtualenv
With a Python 3.10 virtual environment, you can clone and install the repo using
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/jmbannon/ytdl-sub.git
cd ytdl-sub

pip install -e .
```
