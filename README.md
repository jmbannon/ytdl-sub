`ytdl-sub` is a command-line tool that downloads media via 
[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
and prepares it for your favorite media player, including
[Kodi](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc), 
[Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin), 
[Plex](https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker),
[Emby](https://emby.media/),
and modern music players. No additional plugins or external scrapers are needed.

We recognize that everyone stores their 
media differently. Our approach for file and metadata formatting is to provide
maximum flexibility while maintaining simplicity.

## How it Works
`ytdl-sub` uses YAML files to define subscriptions. Each subscription imports _presets_ that
define how to handle and output media files. `ytdl-sub` comes packaged with many _prebuilt presets_
that do the work of config-building, so you can start downloading immediately.

```yaml
# subscriptions.yaml:
# Everything in here can be downloaded using the command:
#   ytdl-sub sub subscriptions.yaml

# __preset__ is a place to define global overrides for all subscriptions
__preset__:
  overrides:
    # Root folder of all ytdl-sub TV Shows
    tv_show_directory: "/tv_shows"
    
    # Root folder of all ytdl-sub Music
    music_directory: "/music"
    
    # Root folder of all ytdl-sub Music Videos
    music_video_directory: "/music_videos"
    
    # For 'Only Recent' preset, only keep vids within this range and limit
    only_recent_date_range: "2months"
    only_recent_max_files: 30
    
  # Pass any arg directly to yt-dlp's Python API
  ytdl_options:
    cookiefile: "/config/cookie.txt"

```commandline
ytdl-sub sub subscriptions.yaml
```
See our
[example subscriptions](https://github.com/jmbannon/ytdl-sub/tree/master/examples)
for more detailed examples and use-cases.

### Output
After `ytdl-sub` runs, the end result will download and format the files into something ready 
to be consumed by your favorite media player/server.
