==================
Subscription File
==================

A subscription file is designed to both define and organize many things
to download in condensed YAML.

.. hint::

  Read the :ref:`getting started guide <guides/getting_started/index:Getting Started>`
  first before reviewing this section.

File Preset
-----------
Many examples show ``__preset__`` at the top. This is known as the *subscription file preset*.
It is where a single :ref:`preset <guides/getting_started/first_config:Custom Preset Definition>`
can be defined that gets applied to each subscription within the file.

This is a good place to apply file-wide variables such as ``tv_show_directory`` or
supply a cookies file path.

.. code-block:: yaml

  __preset__:
    overrides:
      tv_show_directory: "/tv_shows"

    ytdl_options:
      cookiefile: "/config/cookie.txt"


Layout
------
A subscription file is comprised of YAML keys and values. Keys can be either

- a preset
- an override value
- a subscription name

Take the following example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  Jellyfin TV Show by Date:
    = News:
      "Breaking News": "https://www.youtube.com/@SomeBreakingNews"
      "BBC News": "https://www.youtube.com/@BBCNews"

All three types of keys are used for the following:

- ``Jellyfin TV Show by Date`` - a prebuilt preset
- ``= News`` - an override value for genre
- ``Breaking News``, ``BBC News`` - The subscription names

The bottom-most keys, or leaf keys, should always be the subscription name.
It is good practice to put subscription names in quotes to differentiate
between preset names and subscription names.

Values should always be the subscription itself. The simplest form is
just the URL. Further sections will show more exotic examples that go beyond
a single URL.


Inheritance
-----------
A subscription inherits every key above it. In the above example,
both ``Breaking News`` and ``BBC News`` inherits the ``Jellyfin TV Show by Date``
preset and the ``= News`` override value.

.. note::

  There are no limits or boundaries on how one structures
  their presets. This flexibility is intended for subscription authors
  to organize their downloads as they see fit.

Multi Keys
----------
Subscription keys support pipe syntax, or ``|``, which allows multiple
keys to be defined on a single line. The following is equivalent to the above
example:

.. code-block:: yaml

  Jellyfin TV Show by Date | = News:
    "Breaking News": "https://www.youtube.com/@SomeBreakingNews"
    "BBC News": "https://www.youtube.com/@BBCNews"

Override Mode
-------------
Often times, it is convenient to set multiple override values for
a single subscription. We can put a preset in *override mode* by
using tilda syntax, or ``~``.

Suppose we want to apply the :ref:`Only Recent <prebuilt_presets/helpers:Only Recent>`
preset to the above examples. But for ``BBC News`` specifically, we want to
set the date range to be different than the default ``2months`` value to
``2weeks``.

We can change it as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

  Jellyfin TV Show by Date
    = News | Only Recent:
      "Breaking News": "https://www.youtube.com/@SomeBreakingNews"
      "~BBC News":
        url: "https://www.youtube.com/@BBCNews"
        only_recent_date_range: "2weeks"

.. important::

  When using override mode, we need to set the ``url``
  variable since we are no longer using the simplified
  *subscription_value*. For more info on how this works,
  read about :ref:`subscription variables <config_reference/scripting/static_variables:Subscription Variables>`.

Map Mode
--------
Map mode is for highly advanced presets that benefit
from a more complex subscription definition. TODO: Show music video
