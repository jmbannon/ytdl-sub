Why ytdl-sub?
-------------
There is a lack of open-source tools to download media and generate metadata to play it in these players. Most solutions involve using multiple tools or bash scripts to achieve this. ``ytdl-sub`` aims to consolidate all of this logic into a single easy-to-use application that can run automatically once configured.

Why download instead of stream?
-------------------------------
We believe it is important to download what you like because there is no guarantee it will stay online forever. We also believe it is important to download it in such a way that it is easy to consume. Most solutions today force you to watch/listen to your downloaded content via file system or web browser. ``ytdl-sub`` aims to format downloaded content for any media player.
