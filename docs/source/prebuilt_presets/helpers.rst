Common presets are not usable by themselves- setting one of these as the sole preset of your subscription and attempting to download will not work. But you can add these presets to quickly modify an existing preset to better suit your needs.

Best A/V Quality
----------------

Add the following preset to download the best available video and audio quality, and remux it into an MP4 container:

``best_video_quality``


Max 1080p Video
---------------

Add the following preset to download the best available audio and video quality, with the video not greater than 1080p, and remux it into an MP4 container:

``max_1080p``

Chunk Initial Download
----------------------

If you are archiving a large channel, ``ytdl-sub`` will try pulling each video's metadata from newest to oldest before starting any downloads. It is a long process and not ideal. A better method is to chunk the process by using the following preset:

``chunk_initial_download``

It will download videos starting from the oldest one, and only download 20 at a time. You can
change this number by setting:

.. code-block:: yaml

  ytdl_options:
    max_downloads: 30  # Desired number to download per invocation

Once the entire channel is downloaded, remove this preset. Then it will pull metadata from newest to oldest again, and stop pulling additional metadata once it reaches a video that has already been downloaded.
