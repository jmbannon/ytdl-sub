# This example shows how to download and format a Youtube video OR playlist
# to display in Kodi as a music video. Kodi requires music videos to be in
# a shared directory, so we will configure this to make the output directory
# formatted as:
#
#   /path/to/Music Videos
#       Elton John - Rocketman.jpg
#       Elton John - Rocketman.mp4
#       Elton John - Rocketman.nfo
#       System of a Down - Chop Suey.jpg
#       System of a Down - Chop Suey.mp4
#       System of a Down - Chop Suey.nfo
#       ...

    # A single YouTube video is our source/download strategy. However, this
    # can be overwritten to download music videos from a "playlist", as we
    # will see in a preset below
    youtube:
      download_strategy: "video"

    # For advanced YTDL users only; any YTDL parameter can be set here.
    # To download age-restricted videos, you will need to set your cookie
    # file here as a ytdl parameter. For more info, see
    # https://ytdl-sub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#download-age-restricted-youtube-videos

    # ytdl_options:
    #   cookiefile: "path/to/cookie_file.txt

    # For each video downloaded, set the file and thumbnail name here.
    # We set both with {music_video_name}, which is a variable we define in
    # the overrides section further below to represent consistent naming format.
    output_options:
      output_directory: "{music_video_directory}"
      file_name: "{music_video_name}.{ext}"
      thumbnail_name: "{music_video_name}-thumb.jpg"

    # For each video downloaded, add a music video NFO file for it. Populate it
    # with tags that Kodi will read and use to display it in the music or music
    # videos section.
    nfo_tags:
      nfo_name: "{music_video_name}.nfo"
      nfo_root: "musicvideo"
      tags:
        artist: "{artist}"
        title: "{title}"
        album: "Music Videos"
        year: "{upload_year}"

    # Overrides is a section where we can define our own variables, and use them in
    # any other section. We define our music video directory and episode file name
    # here, which gets reused above for the video, thumbnail, and NFO file.
    overrides:
      music_video_directory: "path/to/Music Videos"
      music_video_name: "{artist_sanitized} - {title_sanitized}"

  # It is not always ideal to download all of an artist's music videos.
  # Maybe you only like one song of theirs. We can reuse our preset above
  # to download a single video instead.
  yt_music_video_playlist:
    preset: "yt_music_video"
    youtube:
      download_strategy: "playlist"

    # Setting maintain_download_archive=True is generally a good thing to enable
    # with playlists and channels because it will store previously downloaded
    # video ids to tell YTDL not to re-download them on a successive invocation.
    output_options:
      maintain_download_archive: True
