# This example shows how to download and format a Soundcloud artist's
# discography with tags and album ar. We will configure this to make
# the output directory formatted as:
#
#   /path/to/music
#       /The Be Sharps
#           /[2020] My first upload
#               01 - My first upload.mp3
#               folder.jpg
#           /[2021] My first album
#               01 - Track one.mp3
#               02 - Track two.mp3
#               folder.jpg
#       /Another artist
#           ...

    # For advanced YTDL users only; any YTDL parameter can be set here.

    # For each song downloaded, set the file and thumbnail name here.
    # The output directory stores all artists in a shared {music_directory}.
    # We store the audio file in its respective {album_directory_name} folder
    # with the track number and title. The (thumbnail) album art is stored
    # in the album folder.
    #
    # Another field worth mentioning is maintain_download_archive=True. This
    # is generally a good thing to enable with artists because it will
    # store previously downloaded song IDs to tell YTDL not to re-download
    # them on a successive invocation.

    # For each song downloaded, populate the audio file with music tags.
