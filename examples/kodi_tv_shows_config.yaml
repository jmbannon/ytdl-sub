# This example shows how to download and format an entire Youtube channel
# to display in Kodi as a TV show. The directory format will look like
#
#   /path/to/youtube_tv_shows/My Favorite Youtube Channel
#       /Season 2021
#           s2021.e0317 - St Pattys Day Video.jpg
#           s2021.e0317 - St Pattys Day Video.mp4
#           s2021.e0317 - St Pattys Day Video.nfo
#       /Season 2022
#           s2022.e1225 - Merry Christmas.jpg
#           s2022.e1225 - Merry Christmas.mp4

# The idea is to use dates as the numeric to represent season and episode
# numbers. Once downloaded, it can immediately be recognized by Kodi.
