# Example Configurations
This directory shows how you can use ytdl-sub for various use cases. These
are the configs I personally use and have incorporated as part of the e2e tests.

Each example has a `config.yaml` and `subscription.yaml`. The config defines
_how_ you format your media, whereas the subscription defines _what_ you 
download plus some additional configuring if needed.
