# This example shows how we can use the `kodi_music_videos_config.yaml` preset
# to download music videos in a few different ways. We will use made-up artists
# in each example

###############################################################################
# LEVEL 1 - DOWNLOAD MUSIC VIDEO PLAYLIST

# Subscription names are defined by you. We will call this one john_smith
# for simplicity, and it will download every single video in john_smith's music
# video playlist. Many artists maintain a playlist of all their music videos,
# which makes this an easy way to grab all of them.
john_smith:
  # We must define a preset to use from our config. We named the one in the
  # config example "yt_music_video", so set that here.
  preset: "yt_music_video_playlist"

  # Since our preset download strategy is set to 'playlist', set the playlist id.
  youtube:
    playlist_id: "UCsvn_Po0SmunchJYtttWpOxMg"

  # Overrides can be defined per-subscription. If you noticed, we used {artist}
  # and {sanitized_artist} in our "yt_music_video" preset. We intended to reserve
  # that variable to be defined for each individual subscription. Each override
  # defined here will create a 'sanitized_' version that is safe for file systems.
  #
  # A note for Kodi music videos, it is important to make sure your artist name
  # exactly matches how it is formatted in Kodi itself, otherwise it will be
  # read in as a new artist
  overrides:
    artist: "John Smith and the Instrument Players"

###############################################################################
# LEVEL 2 - DOWNLOAD SINGLE MUSIC VIDEO

# It is not always ideal to download all of an artist's music videos.
# Maybe you only like one song of theirs. We can reuse our preset
# to download a single video instead.
#
# The only difference between this example and the one above is
# - preset
#     Use the music video preset, not the playlist preset
# - youtube.video_id
#     The id of the video to download
#
# Of course, defining yaml configuration to download a single video once
# and never again seems weird. Instead, we can perform this download via
# command:
#
#     ytdl-sub dl                                                     \
#         --preset "yt_music_video"                                   \
#         --youtube.video_id "QhY6r6oAErg"                            \
#         --overrides.artist "John Smith and the Instrument Players"
#
john_smith_one_hit_wonder:
  preset: "yt_music_video"
  youtube:
    video_id: "QhY6r6oAErg"
  overrides:
    artist: "John Smith and the Instrument Players"
