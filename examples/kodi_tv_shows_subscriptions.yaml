# This example shows how we can use the `kodi_tv_shows_config.yaml` preset
# to download channels in a few different ways. We will use made-up channels
# in each example.

# FULL ARCHIVE

# Subscription names are defined by you. We will call this one
# john_smith_archive because it will download every single video in
# john_smith's channel.
john_smith_archive:
  # We must define a preset to use from our config. The one that downloads the
  # entire YouTube channel is called "yt_channel_as_tv", so set that here.
  preset: "yt_channel_as_tv"

  # Our download strategy was Youtube channels. Define the channel url here
  # in our subscription.
  youtube:
    channel_url: "https://youtube.com/channel/UCsvn_Po0SmunchJYtttWpOxMg"

  # Overrides can be defined per-subscription. If you noticed, we used
  # {tv_show_name} and {tv_show_name_sanitized} in our "yt_channel_as_tv"
  # preset. We intended to reserve that variable to be defined for each
  # individual subscription. Each override defined here will create a
  # '_sanitized' version that is safe for file systems.
  overrides:
    tv_show_name: "John /\ Smith"
